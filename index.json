Similar to other dimension reduction approaches, this allows encoding the inherent biological signals of gene expression data, such as pathways or gene programs, into lower-dimensional latent representations. However, the number of cells necessary to adequately uncover such latent representations is often unknown. Therefore, we propose a single-cell variational inference approach for designing experiments (scVIDE) to determine statistical power for detecting cell group structure in a lower-dimensional representation. The approach is based on a test statistic that quantifies the contribution of every single cell to the latent representation. Using a smaller scRNA-seq data set as a starting point, we generate synthetic data sets of various sizes from a fitted VAE. Employing a permutation technique for obtaining a null distribution of the test statistic, we subsequently determine the statistical power for various numbers of cells, thus guiding experimental design. We illustrate with several data sets from various sequencing protocols how researchers can use scVIDE to determine the statistical power for cell group detection within their own scRNA-seq studies. We also consider the setting of transcriptomics studies with large numbers of cells, where scVIDE can be used to determine the statistical power for sub-clustering. For this purpose, we use data from the human KPMP Kidney Cell Atlas and evaluate the power for sub-clustering of the epithelial cells contained therein. To make our approach readily accessible, we provide a comprehensive Jupyter notebook at [https://github.com/MTreppner/scVIDE.jl](https://github.com/MTreppner/scVIDE.jl) that researchers can use to design their own experiments based on scVIDE.","tags":["journal","featured"],"title":"Designing Single Cell RNA-Sequencing Experiments for Learning Latent Representations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eva Brombacher","Maren Hackenberg","Clemens Kreutz","Harald Binder","Martin Treppner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1654473600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654473600,"objectID":"21c2c17eec282340f8e96a5d25cb4ca0","permalink":"https://Treppner.github.io/publication/multiomics/","publishdate":"2022-06-18T18:56:53.844603Z","relpermalink":"/publication/multiomics/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent extensions of single-cell studies to multiple data modalities raise new questions regarding experimental design. For example, the challenge of sparsity in single-omics data might be partly resolved by compensating for missing information across modalities. In particular, deep learning approaches, such as deep generative models (DGMs), can potentially uncover complex patterns via a joint embedding. Yet, this also raises the question of sample size requirements for identifying such patterns from single-cell multi-omics data. Here, we empirically examine the quality of DGM-based integrations for varying sample sizes. We first review the literature and give a short overview of deep learning methods for multi-omics integration. Next, we consider six popular tools in more detail and examine their robustness to different cell numbers, covering two of the most common multi-omics types currently favored. Specifically, we use data featuring simultaneous gene expression measurements at the RNA level and protein abundance measurements for cell surface proteins (CITE-seq), as well as data where chromatin accessibility and RNA expression are measured in thousands of cells (10x Multiome). We examine the ability of the methods to learn joint embeddings based on biological and technical metrics. Finally, we provide recommendations for the design of multi-omics experiments and discuss potential future developments.","tags":["journal","featured"],"title":"The performance of deep generative models for learning joint embeddings of single-cell multi-omics data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martin Treppner","Harald Binder","Moritz Hess"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1641427200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641427200,"objectID":"0540f3d505e05a4c39b5ca4c1457a5d0","permalink":"https://Treppner.github.io/publication/xai/","publishdate":"2022-06-18T18:56:53.844603Z","relpermalink":"/publication/xai/","section":"publication","summary":"Deep generative models can learn the underlying structure, such as pathways or gene programs, from omics data. We provide an introduction as well as an overview of such techniques, specifically illustrating their use with single-cell gene expression data. For example, the low dimensional latent representations offered by various approaches, such as variational auto-encoders, are useful to get a better understanding of the relations between observed gene expressions and experimental factors or phenotypes. Furthermore, by providing a generative model for the latent and observed variables, deep generative models can generate synthetic observations, which allow us to assess the uncertainty in the learned representations. While deep generative models are useful to learn the structure of high-dimensional omics data by efficiently capturing non-linear dependencies between genes, they are sometimes difficult to interpret due to their neural network building blocks. More precisely, to understand the relationship between learned latent variables and observed variables, e.g., gene transcript abundances and external phenotypes, is difficult. Therefore, we also illustrate current approaches that allow us to infer the relationship between learned latent variables and observed variables as well as external phenotypes. Thereby, we render deep learning approaches more interpretable. In an application with single-cell gene expression data, we demonstrate the utility of the discussed methods.","tags":["journal","featured"],"title":"Interpretable generative deep learning: an illustration with single cell gene expression data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martin Treppner","Adrián Salas-Bastos","Moritz Hess","Stefan Lenz","Tanja Vogel","Harald Binder"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1619740800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619740800,"objectID":"ac705bced7406ea81491facc9606f8c4","permalink":"https://Treppner.github.io/publication/scdbm/","publishdate":"2022-06-18T18:56:53.844603Z","relpermalink":"/publication/scdbm/","section":"publication","summary":"Deep generative models, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) or deep Boltzmann machines (DBMs), can generate an arbitrary number of synthetic observations after being trained on an initial set of samples. This has mainly been investigated for imaging data but could also be useful for single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq). A small pilot study could be used for planning a full-scale experiment by investigating planned analysis strategies on synthetic data with different sample sizes. It is unclear whether synthetic observations generated based on a small scRNA-seq dataset reflect the properties relevant for subsequent data analysis steps. We specifically investigated two deep generative modeling approaches, VAEs and DBMs. First, we considered single-cell variational inference (scVI) in two variants, generating samples from the posterior distribution, the standard approach, or the prior distribution. Second, we propose single-cell deep Boltzmann machines (scDBMs). When considering the similarity of clustering results on synthetic data to ground-truth clustering, we find that the 𝑠𝑐𝑉𝐼𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑟 variant resulted in high variability, most likely due to amplifying artifacts of small datasets. All approaches showed mixed results for cell types with different abundance by overrepresenting highly abundant cell types and missing less abundant cell types. With increasing pilot dataset sizes, the proportions of the cells in each cluster became more similar to that of ground-truth data. We also showed that all approaches learn the univariate distribution of most genes, but problems occurred with bimodality. Across all analyses, in comparing 10× Genomics and Smart-seq2 technologies, we could show that for 10× datasets, which have higher sparsity, it is more challenging to make inference from small to larger datasets. Overall, the results show that generative deep learning approaches might be valuable for supporting the design of scRNA-seq experiments.","tags":["journal","featured"],"title":"Synthetic single cell RNA sequencing data from small pilot studies using deep generative models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
